# Documentation: Xi_c0 forced to p+ K- K- pi+ with phase space decay model,
#                daughters required to fly with LHCb acceptance
#                Unlike some other Xic decay files, e.g. 25103010, we don't
#                need to reassign the Lambda_c+ mass because Pythia 8 actually
#                includes Xi_c now, whereas Pythia 6 did not.
