# Descriptor: [B_s0 -> (phi(1020) -> K+ K-) (phi(1020) -> K+ K-)]cc

# NickName: Bs_phiphi=DecProdCut
#
# Cuts: DaughtersInLHCb
#
# Documentation: No direct CPV, There is mixing-induced CPV, but within the SM, the phase of q/p cancels with the weak phases in the penguin decay diagram; hence the total weak phase is zero (indeed control by the 1st parameter)
