# Documentation: Low mass background Lb -> D0 [K+ K- pi+ pi-] X decays of the B+ -> D0b[K- K+ pi- pi+] h+ signal channel. The D0b decays via Mint using a model from CLEO-c. This file is intended to be expanded upon as the data sample increases to allow more low mass backgrounds to be considered. The full set of background files for this decay channel are
